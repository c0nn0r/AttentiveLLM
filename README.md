# AttentiveLLM
AttentiveLLM links a webcam to a voice-mode LLM device (e.g., an iPad). When you look at the device (detected via head-pose “facing camera”), a Raspberry Pi clicks a hacked USB mouse to unmute the mic. When you look away, it clicks again to mute. This enables natural, multi-agent turn-taking with multiple cameras/devices.
